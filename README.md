Here goes the development versions of *rapporter.net* templates.

## Traditional statistics templates

Can be found in [rapport package](https://github.com/Rapporter/rapport) (@aL3xa & @daroczig).

## Wizard

The below templates are made for the laymen: those who do not really know any statistical background, just have some ideas what they want to do with their data. Like: is there any difference in the salary between girls and boys?

These templates can be found in the `wizard` directory.

**Missing templates**:

  * two sample t-test
  * PCA
  * hierarchical cluster
  * MDS
  * glm
